Write a function def checkArmstrong(filename) that reads the file with filename and prints out whether numbers in each line of the file are Armstrong numbers or not.

Note: An Armstrong number is an integer such that the sum of cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.
