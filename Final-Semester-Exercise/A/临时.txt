{'Ross': ' Hey, remember when I had a monkey?\n Yeah, what, what was I thinking?\n What’s up with the greed Joe?\n Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?\n Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!\n Hi!\n Hey, what have you guys been up to?\n Wow!\n After one class? I don’t think so.\n Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi.\n No, it’s a concept!\n All right, maybe it means that too…\n Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!\n Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!\n All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a surprise!!\n All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. \n Y’know what… \n No.\n So what are you gonna do?\n DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!\n A lesson in the importance of unagi. \n Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?\n I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.\n Chandler. I sensed it was you.\n Unagi. I’m always aware.\n What’s up?\n Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.\n Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.\n Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. \n Why not?\n Oh.\n It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!\n Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!\n It’s a great class.\n Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?\n No. No-no. No. What would you do next?\n Yes that’s right.\n I tired attacking two women, did not work.\n No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.\n Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no.\n Ah-ha, nowhere to run! \n DANGER!!!!\n', 'Chandler': ' Yeah.\n Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.\n I see where you’re goin’!\n Ah, finally an explanation.\n Hey-hey, is Monica here?\n Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.\n She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.\n Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.\n Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.\n I made a… \n Nothing!\n Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?\n This, this actually is a… \n Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?\n Do we have to make the entire thing?\n Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.\n What?\n Hey.\n What?!\n Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?\n I can’t figure out what to make Monica.\n I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?\n Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.\n Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.\n Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.\n Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! \n Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?\n Okay, come here! Come here.\n Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.\n But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.\n Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!\n Okay!\n Yeah!\n It’s a sock bunny.\n Not really.\n I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.\n Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…\n Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. \n Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!\n You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.\n Yeah! \n You have done enough!\n No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.\n Oop!\n Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.\n Who the hell is Carl?!\n Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?\n Oh my good God.\n Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.\n Oh, the mixed tape.\n No! You’re the sweetest! \n I am so, so, so, so sorry!\n And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there! \n Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?\n Okay. \n So, are we going in there?\n', 'Joey': ' Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?\n Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!\n All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?! \n Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!\n No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?\n Yeah?\n Uhh do it?\n Well, where was I? \n Takes it out of you? \n Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?\n And of course, crotchless panties.\n You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…\n Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.\n Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?\n Thanks. Well but this one starts now. \n But it’s $2,000.\n Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.\n 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? \n No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! \n Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.\n Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.\n Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is… \n Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.\n Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! \n All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?\n That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?\n Damnit Carl! \n That’s us.\n That’s right, $2,000.\n Damnit Carl!\n', 'Phoebe': ' Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!\n Hey!\n Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!\n Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!\n Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!\n Come on Ross. We’re sorry.

He’s complained about you three times! \n', 'Rachel': ' Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!\n Yeah!\n What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!\n Isn’t that a kind of sushi?\n Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!\n Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.\n Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!\n Aw, I love that.\n Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.\n Hey, wait a minute!
