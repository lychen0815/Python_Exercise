The function should find all the items in the input_dic whose value is not smaller than the threshold_value. Your program should return a list of tuples in which the first item is the key and the second item is the value from the dictionary. Note that to reuse the find_tuple() function, you need to validate that the value of input_dic cannot be a string. Only floating-point and integer value are valid.\n",
