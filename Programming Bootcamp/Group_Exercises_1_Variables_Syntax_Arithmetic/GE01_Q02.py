"""
Pizzas are measured using the diameter and can be Small (25cm), Medium (30cm), Large (35cm), or X-Large (40cm). Assume circular pizza. The area of a circle is
a.Calculate the area of each of the pizzas
b.Write a program that takes in a size of pizza (in cm) and returns the area of the pizza
	Remember that radius is half of the diameter!
	Make sure you display the result to the user!

#input diameter value
