1. Python has many built-in functions (you will have seen print(), input(), and len()) as well as methods for built-in data types. It is often a useful exercise to implement such functions yourself to understand how they work.
Implement a function pop that duplicates the functionality of list.pop except it takes in the list as a parameter. 
Hint: Refer to the documentation for list.pop to understand what it’s supposed to do

You may wish to practise with implementing other list methods.
